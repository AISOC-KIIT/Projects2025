**Beginner Level Projects**



**1. Rocket Launch Failure Prediction** : Space missions are incredibly expensive, and predicting success can help in risk management and insurance planning. Using a historical dataset of space missions (containing details like company, launch location, time, and rocket status), you will build a binary classification model. The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, and train a model to predict whether a mission will result in a "Success" or "Failure" based on the pre-launch parameters, helping to identify factors that historically correlate with mission failures.

**2. Plant Disease Detection** : Farmers often struggle to identify crop diseases early enough to prevent spreading, leading to significant yield loss. You will build an image classification system trained on a dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves (such as the PlantVillage dataset). Users can upload a photo of a suspicious leaf, and the model will analyze the visual symptoms to predict the specific disease (e.g., "Tomato Early Blight"), enabling quicker and more targeted treatment.

**3. Customer Churn Prediction** : For subscription-based businesses like telecom or streaming services, retaining customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones. You will analyze a tabular dataset of customer demographics, billing history, and service usage to identify patterns that precede a cancellation. By training a predictive model on this data, the system will flag "high-risk" customers who are likely to leave (churn), allowing the company to proactively offer discounts or support to retain them.

**4. Voice Gender Recognition** : Identifying speaker characteristics from audio is a fundamental task in audio processing and forensics. You will build a system that extracts acoustic features such as frequency, pitch, and amplitude from short voice recordings. A simple classification model will then analyze these mathematical features to predict the gender of the speaker, introducing you to the basics of audio signal processing and feature extraction.



**Intermediate Level Projects**



**5. Sign Language to Text Converter** : Communication barriers remain a significant challenge for the deaf community in digital spaces. This project involves building a real-time computer vision application that tracks hand movements and skeletal landmarks from a webcam feed. By feeding these coordinate patterns into a sequence classifier, the system will translate dynamic hand gestures into readable text or speech on the screen, enabling smoother interaction between signers and non-signers.

**6. Automatic License Plate Recognition (ANPR)** :  Automated parking and toll systems require the ability to instantly read license plates from moving vehicles under various lighting conditions. You will create a two-stage detection pipeline: first, an object detection model (like YOLO) locates the license plate within a video frame; second, that cropped plate image is passed to an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine to extract the alphanumeric characters. The system must coordinate these steps to log vehicle entry and exit times accurately.

**7. "Chat with Your PDF" (RAG System)** : Students and professionals often need to extract specific answers from massive textbooks or technical manuals without reading every page. You will build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that splits a PDF into smaller text chunks, converts them into numerical vectors, and stores them in a database. When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks and feeds them to an LLM, allowing it to answer the question accurately based only on the document's content.

**8. Music Genre Classification & Recommender** : Categorizing music files often relies on manual tagging, which doesn't capture the actual "sound" or texture of the audio. In this project, you will treat audio analysis as an image recognition problem by converting sound waves into Spectrograms (visual representations of frequencies). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will then analyze these visual patterns to classify songs into genres like Jazz, Rock, or Classical, forming the basis of a content-based music recommendation engine.

**Hard Level Projects**

**9.AI vs. Real: Image Deepfake Detection** : As generative AI becomes capable of creating hyper-realistic faces, the line between reality and fiction is blurring. You will build a forensics model capable of distinguishing between real human faces and those generated by AI (using the CIFAKE dataset, which contains 60,000 real and 60,000 synthetic images).

**10. The AI Lyricist (Creative LLM Fine-Tuning)** : Small AI models often struggle with creativity, rhythm, and specific rhyme schemes, producing robotic or "cringe" poetry. In this project, you will take a small, open-source Large Language Model (like Gemma 2B or TinyLlama) and fine-tune it on a dataset of song lyrics (e.g., Hip-Hop, Pop, or Shakespearean sonnets). Fine-tune the model with LoRA to internalize verse structure, rhyming patterns, and artistic nuance.

**11. Autonomous Drone Navigation (Simulated)**: Drones need to navigate complex, cluttered environments without relying on GPS, which can be unreliable or unavailable. You will develop a Reinforcement Learning agent within a realistic 3D simulator (like AirSim or Unity). The drone must learn to fly from a starting point to a target destination by interpreting visual depth data from its cameras to detect and dodge obstacles autonomously, mimicking how a bird navigates a forest.

**12. Medical Image Segmentation (U-Net)**- In medical diagnostics, doctors need to know the exact volume and shape of a tumor, not just whether one exists. You will implement the U-Net architecture from scratch to perform semantic segmentation on MRI scans (such as the BRATS dataset). The system will learn to classify every single pixel in the image, effectively outlining and coloring the exact boundaries of a brain tumor, which is critical for planning precise surgeries and radiation therapy.
